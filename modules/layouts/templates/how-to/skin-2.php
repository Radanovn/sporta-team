                    <li>The club manager logs in via My Management, clicks in the club environment to the menu “Insurance” - “New Declaration” and follows the steps listed there.</li>
                    <li>If possible, Sporta will check the declaration the same day and confirm it with Ethias. At the same time, you will receive a confirmation letter from Sporta with Ethias file number and the steps to be followed. From that moment on, the club manager can consult the processed declaration via the extranet. If there is an email address of the victim in My Administration, he or she will also receive the confirmation letter by email.</li>
                    <li>As soon as the confirmation letter has arrived, you can send the medical certificate (to be completed by the doctor) to Ethias, Prins&#8209;Bisschopssingel 73, 3500 Hasselt or by email: damagemanagement@ethias.be. Be sure to include your file number!</li>
                    <li>If Ethias has the medical certificate, Ethias will send the victim a letter with the file number, a brief summary of the guarantees and a recovery certificate.</li>
                    <li>The victim takes the bills of the doctor, pharmacist, physiotherapist, hospital… to the health insurance fund. That already reimburses part of the costs and makes a difference statement (“Kwijtschrift Geneeskundige Verzrekschappen”).</li>
                    <li>The victim then sends the supporting documents and difference statements from the health insurance fund to Ethias (stating the file number and account number).</li>
                    <li>Ethias reimburses the treatment costs directly to the victim.</li>
