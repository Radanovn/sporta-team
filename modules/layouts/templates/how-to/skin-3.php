                    <li>First, the victim and the treating physician complete the report form. If it concerns a&nbsp;sports accident outside a club context, use this report form.</li>
                    <li>Have the club manager complete it - depending on the internal agreements at your club - and send it within 8 days to: Sporta-federatie vzw, Boomgaardstraat 22 bus 50, 2600 Berchem.</li>
                    <li>Sporta federation checks these declaration forms and sends them to Ethias every week. It may therefore take a week before the form is sent from Sporta to Ethias. You do not have that waiting time if you go via Extranet.</li>
                    <li>The victim will receive written confirmation from Sporta stating that the file has been sent to Ethias.</li>
                    <li>Ethias in turn sends a receipt report to the victim. It contains a file number, a short summary of the guarantees and a recovery certificate. Declarations via form cannot be consulted online.</li>
                    <li>The victim takes the bills of the doctor, pharmacist, physiotherapist, hospital ... to the health insurance fund. That already pays back part of it and makes a differen&#8209;ce statement (“Medical Dispensation Dispensation Certificate”).</li>
                    <li>The victim then sends the supporting documents and difference statements from the health insurance fund to Ethias (stating the file number and account number).</li>
                    <li>Ethias reimburses the treatment costs directly to the victim.</li>
